 We buy and sell second-hand costumes (a price lise is available) as well.<br>
On the first Saturday of every month we hold a "CossiePlay Party" at the town hall.<br>

Each entry includes one non-alcoholic drink and a glow stick. Parties start at 6pm and run until 11pm. <br>

and dancing is common (but not required)</p></div>
